Customer Segmentation for Banking Strategy using Clustering Algorithms
---------------

Project Description:
---------------------

This project focuses on segmenting bank customers into distinct groups using K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The dataset includes customer information such as age, account balance, campaign interactions, previous contacts, and other behavioral and demographic features.

By applying K-Means, the project identifies patterns and similarities among customers that are not immediately obvious. These segments help the bank to better understand customer behavior, optimize marketing strategies, and personalize offers for different customer groups.
-------------

The workflow includes:
-------------

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and managing outliers to ensure accurate clustering.

Feature scaling: Standardizing numerical features to improve K-Means performance.

Clustering with K-Means: Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

Analysis & visualization: Understanding the characteristics of each cluster to provide actionable business insights.
---------------

Outcome:
The project produces meaningful customer segments that can guide marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and enhance decision-making in banking operations.
